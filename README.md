Github Link: [Lagerer](https://github.com/Charging1948/lagerer)

## Description
This is a simple game written in Java. The goal is to earn as much money as possible. You can earn money by fulfilling orders.

## How to play
- You have a storage in which you can store items. On the right hand side of the screen you can get a new order.
- After getting a new order you can select the order, to be able to store it inside your warehouse.
- You will see that the grid buttons on the left hand side switched colors when selecting an order. This shows you where you can store the item.


## Orders-File
The orders file has been modified. I have taken all of the orders and put them inside of the `DummyOrderGenerator` class. This class will hold information about all upcoming orders.
